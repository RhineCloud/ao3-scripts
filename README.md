# ao3-scripts

As with other userscripts, just point the add-on you're using to the code file of the script you want.

## find-tag-in-blurbs

It compares each tag in a work blurb with the tag in the title of the page and colours the ones that match. (On works/bookmarks landing pages for canonical tags this only works where the actual canonical has been used, and not syns or subtags.)

The default colouring uses white text on an AO3 red background, but can be adjusted by changing the colour values at the end of the script.
